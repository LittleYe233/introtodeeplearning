We'll train the model to perform this task. \n\nTo achieve this, we will input a sequence of characters to the model, and train the model to predict the output, that is, the following character at each time step.

We'll train our RNN using batches of song snippets from our dataset, which we generated in the previous section.\n\nThe model is based off the LSTM architecture, where we use a state vector to maintain information about the temporal relationships between consecutive characters. The final output of the LSTM is then fed into a fully connected [`Dense`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense) layer where we'll output a softmax over each character in the vocabulary, and then sample from this distribution to predict the next character. \n\nAs we introduced in the first portion of this lab, we'll be using the Keras API, specifically, [`tf.keras.Sequential`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/models/Sequential), to define the model. Three layers are used to define the model:\n\n* [`tf.keras.layers.Embedding`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Embedding): This is the input layer, consisting of a trainable lookup table that maps the numbers of each character to a vector with `embedding_dim` dimensions.\n* [`tf.keras.layers.LSTM`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM): Our LSTM network, with size `units=rnn_units`. \n* [`tf.keras.layers.Dense`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense): The output layer, with `vocab_size` outputs.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning/2019/lab1/img/lstm_unrolled-01-01.png\" alt=\"Drawing\"/>",

This predicted character is then used as the next input to the model.\n\n* At each time step, the updated RNN state is fed back into the model, so that it now has more context in making the next prediction. After predicting the next character, the updated RNN states are again fed back into the model, which is how it learns sequence dependencies in the data, as it gets more information from the previous predictions.\n\n![LSTM inference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning/2019/lab1/img/lstm_inference.png)\n\nComplete and experiment with this code block (as well as some of the aspects of network definition and training!), and see how the model performs. How do songs generated after training with a small number of epochs compare to those generated after a longer duration of training?",

It's a pretty big accomplishment, and hopefully you have some sweet tunes to show for it.\n\nConsider how you may improve your model and what seems to be most important in terms of performance. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n*  How does the number of training epochs affect the performance?\n*  What if you alter or augment the dataset? \n*  Does the choice of start string significantly affect the result? \n\nTry to optimize your model and submit your best song! **MIT students and affiliates will be eligible for prizes during the IAP offering**. To enter the competition, MIT students and affiliates should upload the following to the course Canvas:\n\n* a recording of your song;\n* iPython notebook with the code you used to generate the song;\n* a description and/or diagram of the architecture and hyperparameters you used -- if there are any additional or interesting modifications you made to the template code, please include these in your description.\n\nYou can also tweet us at [@MITDeepLearning](https://twitter.com/MITDeepLearning) a copy of the song! See this example song generated by a previous 6.S191 student (credit Ana Heart): <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnaWhatever16/status/1263092914680410112?s=20\">song from May 20, 2020.</a>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nHave fun and happy listening!\n\n![Let's Dance!](http://33.media.tumblr.com/3d223954ad0a77f4e98a7b87136aa395/tumblr_nlct5lFVbF1qhu7oio1_500.gif)",
